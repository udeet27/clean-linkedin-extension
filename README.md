Tired of spammy and irrelevant content on your LinkedIn feed? This simple extension automatically hides posts that contain hashtags like #collab or #preplacedcollab, giving you a cleaner, more focused LinkedIn experience. Undisclosed or barely disclosed ads ruin the site. Cast such people to the void.
